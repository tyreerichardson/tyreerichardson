> Professional button-presser, occasional coder, full-time imposter.

Welcome to the source of bugs, mysterious commits, and occasional moments of accidental genius. If you’re here to judge my code — joke’s on you, I already beat you to it.

## 🙃 Who Am I?

I’m a *"software engineer"* in the same way someone who owns a guitar is in a band. I write code, yell at it, then run it with fingers crossed. Sometimes it works. Sometimes it *really* doesn’t.

Things I’m *allegedly* good at:
- Making programs that simulate gravity but somehow break reality
- Convincing generative AI to say weird stuff
- Copy-pasting with flair
- Typing fast enough to look impressive in coffee shops
- Following SOLID principles like a *true* professional (or at least pretending to)

## ⚒️ The Toolbelt of Dubious Expertise

| 💻 JS       | ★★★☆☆      | Equal parts power and regret. |
| 🧠 ML       | ★★☆☆☆      | I make AI guess things. Sometimes it’s right. That’s on me. |
| 🤖 Gen AI   | ★★☆☆☆      | I once trained a model. It learned bad habits from me. |
| 🐙 Git      | ★★☆☆☆      | “commit -am ‘final final FINAL fix’” — Me |
| 🛜 APIs      | ★★★☆☆      | Fluent in JSON. Not emotionally, just technically. |

## 🚧 Projects That Keep Me Up at Night

- **🌌 Gravity Space Simulator**  
  Because flinging planets around in fake space is cheaper than therapy.

- **🧠 AI... Something**  
  I forgot what it does, but it has a cool name and uses a GPU.

- **🕹️ Potential MMORPG Clone (Top Secret)**  
  NDA signed with myself. Features include: bugs, lag, and way too much ambition.

## 🎯 Career Goals That Sound Impressive

- Work at **Discord** or **NVIDIA**, and pretend to understand everything in the first few months.
- Start a billion-dollar company with four lines of code and a README.
- Master Kubernetes. Or at least learn how to spell it consistently.
- **Create a Non-Profit Coffee-Shop/Study Bar**  
  Called **The Hive**, a place where STEM enthusiasts can learn, collaborate, and potentially break things. Shaped like a bee hive because... why not? Plus, it’ll have an online presence to keep things ‘trendy’ and slightly more organized than my personal GitHub.

## 📈 Look! Numbers!

They don’t mean anything. But they’re shiny and make me feel accomplished.

## 🧃 Other Fun Facts

- My code editor has seen things.
- I once fixed a bug by deleting half the project. It worked. Still scared.
- I learned everything I know from YouTube and mild panic.
- My coding style is “if it runs, it ships.”
